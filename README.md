#Pyber Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to graph rideshare data to visualize rides, fares, and the differences between types of cities. Categorizing the data will help determine how to go about making ride sharing more available and efficient.

##Results:
Our data is broken down using into total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, average fare per driver and then categorized into urban, suburban, and rural city types. With the use of the pandas groupby() function we were able to sort through our dataframes and snag the particular data to focus on. After gathering, cleaning, and sorting the data we created graphic visualizations using scatter plots, box and whisker plots, pie charts, and a line graph depicting our findings.

###Analysis Challenges:
It was challenging to put together so many categories and subcategories of data together. It was important to pay close attention to which data frame I was pulling data from but with lots of double checking and some pencil and paper for notes, I was able to stay mentally organized.

##Summary:
We can see that the vast majority of rides were in urban cities but they tend to be smaller fares. The opposite can be said for rural areas. More data from previous years could help us learn the way ride sharing has grown in each city type. Also, we could use data regarding customer wait times for rides to help see which areas could use more drivers.
